# Vue UI Fields

UI Fields is a plugin to easily create full functional forms in your Vue application.

Automatically create different types of fields based on a simpel json coming from your cms.


## Features

- Different types of input elements and single components
- Custom input types
- Create conditional fields
- Add custom styling
- Keep your forms data stored in VUEX and use them anywhere in your application.

## Installation

``` bash
# install
npm i @matise/ui-fields --save
# OR yarn add @matise/ui-fields
```

## usage

We've tested the module in multiple situations. Most of the time in Nuxt and Vuepress.

- Installation for [Nuxt](https://vue-ui-fields.matise.nl/)



### Why did we make this?

We made this module while making a few nuxt websites with a wordpress/woocommerce backend. We needed to create whole forms which could be created from the backend.

### Any ideas?

Please add an issue or do a PR, we are open for additions!
